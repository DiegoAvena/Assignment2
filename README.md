Game Of life simulator

In order to implement some parts of this project, I referenced the following:

1.)http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/ in order to learn how the clock method works so that I can create 
a small delay between generations without using system("pause") if the user wants this to happen

2.)https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/header-guards/ in order to learn how guards work to 
an error that prevents compiling due to multiple definitions

3.) Multiple parts of the course book Data Structures and Algorithms to get information on how to inherit from classes
in c++, how to deallocate a 2d array in c++, and how to do error handling in c++.
